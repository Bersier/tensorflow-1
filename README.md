This project is mainly about the creation of more typeful abstractions on top of TensorFlow.

It is very much incomplete and exploratory.

The most significant abstraction added so far is `View`, which will allow the use of algebraic data types and tensors compositionally as inputs and outputs to models, without sacrificing performance.
